# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to devise a solution to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a given number of characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a text file containing a single character 'H' and two available operations - Copy All and Paste - the objective is to determine the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Minimum Operations

Write a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to achieve exactly n 'H' characters in the file.
